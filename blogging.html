        offers 10 top tips to put your bike on the road</h2>

        Commuting by bike is a great way to breathe in some fresh air, move your
        legs and get your heart pumping. Unfortunately, on busy roads it can also
        be very daunting – trying to dodge drivers, potholes, and pedestrians
        can seem terrifying. No one likes to show up for work frazzled and
        exhausted from the effort of just getting there, so here are 10 tips on
        how to make your commute bike-friendly.

        The route you usually drive or take bus probably isn’t the best for your
        cycle commute. If you are in the capital, you are in luck – London is building
        some great cycling infrastructure and a route that may seem a bit out of the
        way can actually be safer and save you time. TfL cycle route planner is a good
        place to start. Google maps also has cycling friendly routes, Sustrans has maps
        for longer, more rural routes, or just follow other cyclists one day to see what
        secrets they know!

        Smile! Sing! Enjoy the time outside! Cycle commuting doesn’t have to be a
        serious pursuit of dodging tricks and traps. Smile at the people crossing
        the street or send a wink over to the other cyclist in the bike box wearing
        rainbow socks. It’s harder for someone to get angry at a happy person, so be
        the happy one!
